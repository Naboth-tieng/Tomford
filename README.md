# Getting Started with TomFord-Inspired React App

This React application is inspired by TomFord and is designed to showcase products and include a store mechanism. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have XAMPP installed on your machine and have completed the setup for the TomFord backend. Refer to the additional instructions in the "tomford" folder for backend configuration.

## TomFord Backend Setup

Navigate to the "tomford" folder within this project, which contains additional instructions for setting up the TomFord backend. Follow the steps outlined in the README file to configure the backend environment.

## React App Scripts

In the main project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
