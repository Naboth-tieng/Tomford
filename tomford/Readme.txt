# Installation Guide for TomFord Project

To successfully set up the TomFord project on your machine, follow these steps:

Make sure you have XAMPP installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [XAMPP official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Step 2: Navigate to the Htdocs Folder

Locate the Htdocs folder in your XAMPP installation directory. Typically, it is found under `Xampp > applications > Htdocs`.

### Step 3: Copy the TomFord Folder

Take the folder named "tomford" from your TomFord project and paste it into the Htdocs directory. Ensure that you copy it exactly as it is.

### Step 4: Start XAMPP Services

Open the XAMPP control panel and start both the Apache and MySQL services.

### Step 5: Access PhpMyAdmin

Click the "Admin" button next to MySQL in the XAMPP control panel to access PhpMyAdmin.

### Step 6: Create a New Database

Within PhpMyAdmin, create a new database named "tomford" specifically for the project's connection.
